# An Exploration of Song Speechiness

I first followed Georgios Karamanis' lead and assessed how three song descriptors evolved through the decades. 
Speechiness showed the most noticeable difference over time. Next, I investigated how speechiness has evolved by genre. 
As expected, rap music clearly demonstrates the highest prevalence of the spoken word. But interestingly, the
spoken word has decreased in recent years from it's peak in the 1990's. Notably, over the same time period, speech has 
become more prominent in other genres.
